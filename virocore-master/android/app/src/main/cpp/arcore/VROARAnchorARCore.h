 Superclass for all ARCore anchors. Unlike ARKit, where trackables and anchors are a merged
 concept, in ARCore they are separate. In ARCore, we check for updated trackables each frame
 in the VROARSessionARCore. For each trackable found, we create an ARAnchor corresponding to it:
 these are known as "managed" anchors. Managed anchors own the actual internal (ARCore) anchor,
 and maintain a link to the corresponding trackable (which is *also* a subclass of VRARAnchor).
