/**
 * ViroCore is a platform for Java developers to easily build native AR and VR experiences.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * ViroCore combines a high-performance rendering engine with a descriptive API for creating
 * immersive AR/VR apps. While lower-level APIs like OpenGL require you to learn and precisely
 * implement rendering algorithms, ViroCore requires only high-level scene descriptions. Easily add
 * animations, physics, particle effects, and more to your Android applications.
 * <p>
 * For help getting started using ViroCore, try the <a href="https://virocore.viromedia.com/docs/getting-started">Getting
 * Started</a> guide, or take a look at <a href="https://github.com/viromedia/virocore">Code
 * Samples</a>.
 * <p>
 * For higher level documentation, see the <a href="https://virocore.viromedia.com/docs/scenes">Development Guides</a>.
