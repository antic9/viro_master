/**
 * DirectionalLight is a {@link Light} that illuminates all objects in the {@link Scene} from the
 * same direction with constant intensity. Because the intensity is constant, there is no
 * attenuation of a DirectionalLight and the position of the {@link Node} it is in has no impact.
 * <p>
 * DirectionalLight is meant to emulate powerful, far-away light sources like the sun.
 * <p>
 * DirectionalLight can cast shadows. These shadows are cast using an orthographic projection (e.g.
 * the size of the shadows does not change as the shadow casters' distance from the light changes).
 * This best simulates shadows cast from light sources like the sun.
 * <p>
 * For an extended discussion on Lights, refer to the <a href="https://virocore.viromedia.com/docs/3d-scene-lighting">Lighting
 * and Materials Guide</a>.
