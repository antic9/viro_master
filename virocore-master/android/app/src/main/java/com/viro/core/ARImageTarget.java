/**
 * ARImageTarget contains all the information required to find and track an image and extract its

 * <p>
 *
 * <ol>
 * </ul><p>
 * <li>Create an ARImageTarget representing the image you would like to find in the real-world.
 * <li>Add the ARImageTarget to your app by using {@link ARScene#addARImageTarget(ARImageTarget)}.
 * <li>Once an image target is added to the scene, you will receive a callback when an instance of that
 * image is detected in the world. The callback will come through {@link
 * com.viro.core.ARScene.Listener#onAnchorFound(ARAnchor, ARNode)}, with an anchor of type {@link
 * ARImageAnchor}.
 * <li>Use {@link ARImageAnchor#getAnchorId()} and compare against {@link
 * ARImageTarget#getId()} to identify which of your targets was found in the world.</ol><p>
 *
 * Note that for each {@link ARImageTarget} added to the scene, there will be only one instance of
 * that target found.
