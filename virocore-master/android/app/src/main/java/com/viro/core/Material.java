         * <p>
         * <ul><li> The diffuse or <i>albedo</i> texture defines the base color of the material.
         * This can be set by {@link #setDiffuseTexture(Texture)}</li> <li>The metalness value or
         * texture defines how "metallic" the surface is, which influences the degree to which light
         * refracts and reflects off the surface, the sharpness of the reflections, and more. This
         * can be set by {@link #setMetalnessMap(Texture)}, or, if a uniform value is preferred,
         * {@link #setMetalness(float)}.</li> <li>The roughness value or texture defines the
         * roughness of the microfacets on the surface. The rougher a surface is, the more light
         * will scatter along completely different directions, resulting in larger and more muted
         * specular reflections. Smoother surfaces, meanwhile, exhibit a sharper specular reflection
         * as light rays are more likely to reflect in a uniform direction. Roughness can be set by
         * {@link #setRoughnessMap(Texture)}, or, if a uniform value is preferred, {@link
         * #setRoughness(float)} </li> <li>The ambient occlusion value or texture approximates how
         * exposed the surface is to ambient lighting. This has no effect on direct lights (it does
         * not result in clear shadows) but it darkens enclosed and sheltered areas. These textures
         * are typically authored using modeling tools along with roughness and metalness. Ambient
         * occlusion can be set by {@link #setAmbientOcclusionMap(Texture)}.</li> <li>The lighting
         * environment is a {@link Texture} (typically an HDR equirectangular image) that acts as a
         * global light source, illuminating surfaces with diffuse and specular ambient light. We
         * treat each pixel in the lighting environment as a light emitter, thereby capturing the
         * environment's global lighting and general feel. This gives objects a sense of belonging
         * to their environment. For this reason it is common to use the scene's background texture
         * as the lighting environment, but this is not necessary. To set the lighting environment
         * use {@link Scene#setLightingEnvironment(Texture)}. </li> </ul>

         * the specular texture ({@link #setSpecularTexture(Texture)}) and the shininess property
