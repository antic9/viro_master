 The transform of each bone can be either concatenated, local, or legacy. Skeletal
 animations are responsible for setting the transform. The VROSkinner is able to
 handle each of these transform types to drive an animation.
 
 Concatenated transforms move the bone (and in turn any associated mesh vertices)
 from bind position in bone local space, to the animated position in model space.
 
 Local transforms move the bone from the bind position in bone local space to the
 animated position in the bone local space of the *parent* bone.
 
 Legacy transforms (deprecated) move the bone from the bind position in bone local
 space to the animated position in bone local space.

/*
 VROBones are the control points for skeletal animation. They are animatable: 
 to drive a skeletal animation, invoke setTransform() for the bones that should
 be animated within an animation block. This will animate the bones, which in
 turn animates the VROSkeleton, which in turn (by way of VROSkinner objects) 
 animates any attached VROGeometry objects.
 
 The transform of each bone can be either concatnated, local, or legacy. Skeletal
 animations are responsible for setting the transform. The VROSkinner is able to
 handle each of these transform types to drive an animation. See VROBoneTransformType
 above for detail on each transform type, and VROSkinner.cpp for how Viro handles
 each transform type.

 Typically the transform is a concatenated, meaning each bone transform contains
 all transforms moving down the skeleton hierarchy: e.g., the transform for the
 finger bone is a concatenation of the upper arm transform, the lower arm transform,
 the hand transform, and finally the finger transform.
 
 Regardless of the transform type, the input coordinates to the bone transform
 (e.g. the coordinates that are multiplied by the bone transform) are assumed
 to be in bone local space, bind position. The bindTransform in each VROSkinner is
 responsible for transforming geometries into this space and position. See VROSkinner.h
 for more details.
