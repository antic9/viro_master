    // Iterate through the characters, finding the best typeface for each. Since we're
    // using wide-strings, we expect each character to be a Unicode code point. This is
    // almost always the case, with two complications:
    //
    // 1. Surrogates. Our 2-byte wide characters support all characters in the "Basic
    //    Multilingual Plane" (BMP). There are some characters in Unicode, however, that
    //    require 4 bytes. These are typically mathematical characters, musical symbols,
    //    and rare CJK (Chinese/Japanese/Korean) characters. These are supported in UTF-16
    //    via surrogates. We do not currently support surrogates.
    //
    // 2. Variation sequences. Variation sequences are pairs of code points, a base
    //    character followed by a variation selector. The variation selector is
    //    essentially a 'modifier' that alters the base character. For each code point,
    //    we have to check to see if the _next_ code point is a variation selector. These
    //    are supported by Viro.
