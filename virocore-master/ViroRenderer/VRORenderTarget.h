 Renderbuffers should be used when we do *not* need to sample the output of a
 render target. Textures should be used when we do need to read back the output.
 
 The sRGB formats will make the framebuffer convert from linear RGB to sRGB
 (gamma 2.0) on all writes. This typically is only necessary on the final render pass,
 since we want most color operations to occur in linear space.
 
 Note: on iOS the sRGB render targets do not appear to be properly handling the
