/*
 Manages the UBOs (Uniform Buffer Objects) that link lights to shaders.
 UBOs enable us to share data among shaders, so we only have to bind 
 the new light settings when the lights themselves change, or when we 
 change what lights we're rendering. We do not have to rebind every time
 the shader changes.
 
 UBOs have three components: the UBO itself (_lightingUBO), a binding
 point (_lightingUBOBindingPoint), and a block index (_lightingBlockIndex).
 
 The _lightingUBO is similar to a VBO: it's essentially a block of GPU
 memory. Unlike a VBO, however, it can be read in GLSL shaders as 
 structured data. The VROLightingData struct, above, matches the lighting
 layout in lighting_general_functions.glsl. We write into _lightingUBO
 whenever the lights change, updating the fields.
 
 The VROShaderProgram::sLightingFragmentUBOBindingPoint is similar to
 a texture unit. It is independent of shaders, and there are fixed number
 of these in our EGL context. Every time we create a new UBO *type*, we
 have to create a new binding point. The binding point is re-used for all
 UBO instances of a specific type. E.g. there is one binding point for all
 bone UBOs, one for all lighting UBOs, etc. Before rendering we have to
 bind our specific UBO to the binding point of that UBO's type via
 glBindBufferBase.
 
 Finally, the _lightingBlockIndex is *shader-specific*; it's found in 
 VROShaderProgram. It's similar to a shader's uniform location. When we
 compile a shader with a layout in it, that layout is given an index in 
 the shader, much like any uniform. We retrieve this location via 
 glGetUniformBlockIndex. Once we have this location, we can bind it to a
 specific UBO by invoking glUniformBlockBinding. This binds a shader's 
 uniform layout to a specific UBO binding point. The binding point, in 
 turn, was earlier bound to a specific UBO.
 
 What does all of this enable?
 
 1. We can have multiple batches of lights, each represented by their 
    own UBO. To switch from one batch to another, we just have to call 
    glBindBufferBase. OpenGL will know what what shader block index corresponds
    to that binding point (from glUniformBlockBinding).
 
 2. When we update lights, we don't have to update every shader. We just 
    glBufferSubData into the _lightingUBO for each batch that uses those
    lights.
 
 Finally, quick note on why binding points exist. Why not directly bind 
 uniform blocks in shaders to UBOs? Why do we need this extra level of 
 indirection? The answer is the same reason texture units exist: hardware
 limitations. It's the same reason we don't directly map shader texture 
 uniforms to texture IDs; we instead map them to texture units. This is 
 because there can only be so many units of memory on the GPU used 
 simultaneously for these things. Binding points enforce the limit.
