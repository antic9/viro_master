# ViroRenderer on WebAssembly

## Command line builds

1. Download Emscripten
2. Run Emscripten's environment script to set the environment (change path below to your Emscripten SDK)
```
source ~/Source/emsdk/emsdk_env.sh --build=Release
```
3. Build with the build.sh script, passing in the test target you'd like to build
```
./build.sh viro_test_fbx
```
4. Start a local webserver to run the target using the run script
```
./run.sh
```
5. Navigate to http://localhost:8080/build/viro_fbx_test.html

## CLion builds

1. Download Emscripten
2. Download CLion
3. Open CLion and choose 'Create project from existing sources'
4. Choose the `/ViroRenderer/wasm` folder
5. Wait for it to sync for a bit
6. If the IDE tells you that project sources are located outside the project would, and asks you if you would like to chnage the project root, hit 'YES' (Change the project root). This *should* happen.
7. Open up preferences (Command-Period)
8. Navigate to `Build, Execution, Deployment` -> `CMake`
9. Create a new Profile called 'Emscripten'
    * Name: Emscripten
    * Build type: Release
    
    * For the following options, get _your_ paths by sourcing the EMSDK environment (step 2 above). It prints out the value of these variables
    
     _Example_ 
    * CMake options: -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=/Users/radvani/Source/emsdk/emscripten/1.37.34/cmake/Modules/Platform/Emscripten.cmake
    * Environment Variables
        * EMSDK: /Users/radvani/Source/emsdk
        * EM_CONFIG: /Users/radvani/.emscripten
        * BINARYEN_ROOT: /Users/radvani/Source/emsdk/clang/e1.37.34_64bit/binaryen
        * EMSCRIPTEN: /Users/radvani/Source/emsdk/emscripten/1.37.34
    * Generation path: products

10. DELETE the other profiles (e.g. Debug): this forces CLion to also use the Emscripten profile when compiling in the IDE
11. Wait for the IDE to sync
12. At the top right, change to Emscripten, and the target you want to build (e.g. viro_test_fbx)
13. Build!
     Note: if you can an error that the working directory `Products` does not exist, create it under ViroRenderer/wasm

14. To run with CLion, go to  `Run` -> `Edit Configurations` 
15. Choose the desired target: e.g. `viro_fbx_test`
16. Set Executable to `run.sh` (in the ViroRenderer/wasm directory)
17. Set Program Arguments to `--no_browser --port 8080 ./products/build/`
18. Set Environment Variable: `PATH=$PATH:/Users/radvani/Source/emsdk/emscripten/1.37.34:/usr/bin`
      (Note: change to _your_ Emscripten path. The usr/bin is for Python)
19. Run!
20. Navigate to http://localhost:8080/build/viro_fbx_test.html
